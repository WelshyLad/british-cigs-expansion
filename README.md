This Github Repo is a Template Repository for those, who are interested in creating their own cigarette brand extension.

Any Addon/Mod based on this template will have a dependency on the main `Immersion Cigs - Rewrite` Mod.

## Prerequisites

- An Image Editing Tool
  - `.psd` files with layers and smartobjects are available for easier adaptation.
  - I have used Photoshop. Gimp might be fine as well but untested.
- Arma 3 Tools - https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/
  - Object Builder to edit a texture path of the cigpack.p3d
  - Publisher to publish your mod to the steam workshop
- Hemtt - https://hemtt.dev/
  - To build The mod
  - `winget install BrettMayson.HEMTT`
- Text Editor or Dev Environment that can replace strings across multiple files
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Github
  - A basic understanding on how to work with github.
  - A github account
  - https://github.com/apps/desktop
- A basic understanding of arma mod making, macro's and config work. While I try to make the guide as approachable as possible, I will not explain basic modding principles.
